# Abstract Reduction Systems Exercises
# Exercise: String Rewriting

Example 1:

This string rewriting exercise is a basic example of an abstract reduction system in which we treat strings as terms composed of letters a,b that can be rewritten or reduced based on a set of rewrite rules or pattern.

Consider the schemas of rules:
```

  ab -> ba
  ba -> ab
  aa ->
  b ->

```
